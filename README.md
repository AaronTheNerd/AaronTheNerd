## Hello!
My name is Aaron Barge, I majored in Computer Engineering at UofSC (graduated May 2021).

## My Interests
I'm interested in programming in a professional environment. I enjoy problem solving and working with highly technical code.

## My Languages
Python ([88th percentile](https://app.pluralsight.com/profile/aaron-barge)):
> Python isn't a language which I learned from a course at UofSC. Instead, the data structures and algorithms course which I was taking used Python for testing our code submissions and I began to learn the language on my own. For the last 2 years, I have been using Python as a go to for turning any ideas I have into working projects. This is why my [Personal-Coding-Projects](https://github.com/AaronTheNerd/Personal-Coding-Projects) repository is full of Python projects.

My favorite Python project:

C++ ([70th percentile](https://app.pluralsight.com/profile/aaron-barge)):
> C++ has always been one of my favorite languages and is the languages which I primarily used while obtaining my degree at UofSC. Whenever I want to write highly optimized or very technical programs this is my language of choice.
