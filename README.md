<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Aaron Barge</h1>
<h3 align="center">A recent Computer Engineering graduate from the University of South Carolina.</h3>

I graduated from UofSC with a degree in Computer Engineering in May of 2021 with a 3.5 GPA. During my time at UofSC I constantly went above and beyond in my courses. Whenever a new language would be used in a course, I would always go out of my way to create my own small projects to get accustomed to the language. For example, when I first started learning Matlab for an Electrical Engineering course, I practiced the language by creating my own toolbox which could help with much of my early electronic analysis. Another time, when I had to use Prolog for the first half of a Programming Language Structures course, I completed 20 out of the [99 Prolog Problems](https://www.ic.unicamp.br/~meidanis/courses/mc336/2009s2/prolog/problemas/). My solutions can be found [here](https://github.com/AaronTheNerd/Personal-Coding-Projects/tree/master/Prolog/99Problems). 

Additionally, I have always enjoyed problem solving and applying my knowledge in my personal experiences. For example, while I worked at Code Ninjas, I used my programming experience to design and implement a program which could [create and run animations on a Christmas Tree](https://github.com/AaronTheNerd/Personal-Coding-Projects/tree/master/Arduino/Tree).

Eventually, I'd like to work with the hardware components of computers, or at least very low-level code. I enjoy problem solving

<h2 align="left">Languages</h3>

Python ([88th percentile](https://app.pluralsight.com/profile/aaron-barge)):
> Python isn't a language which I learned from a course at UofSC. Instead, the data structures and algorithms course which I was taking used Python for testing our code submissions and I began to learn the language on my own. For the last 2 years, I have been using Python as a go to for turning any ideas I have into working projects. This is why my [Personal-Coding-Projects](https://github.com/AaronTheNerd/Personal-Coding-Projects) repository is full of Python projects.

My favorite Python project:

C++ ([70th percentile](https://app.pluralsight.com/profile/aaron-barge)):
> C++ has always been one of my favorite languages and is the languages which I primarily used while obtaining my degree at UofSC. Whenever I want to write highly optimized or very technical programs this is my language of choice.

Verilog:
> Verilog is a language which I became relatively accustomed to my final year at UofSC. I learned much about this language when I completed a project for my Advanced Digital Design course where we had to design and implement a three-stage RISC-V CPU. This language has been fascinating to me for its resembalance to electronic circuits and I would love to develop professionally in this language.

On top of these languages, I also have experience with: Javascript ([83rd percentile](https://app.pluralsight.com/profile/aaron-barge)), Java ([68th percentile](https://app.pluralsight.com/profile/aaron-barge)), Matlab, and Haskell. My full list of projects and languages can be found on my [Portfolio](https://aaronthenerd.github.io/Portfolio).
